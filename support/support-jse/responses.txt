Furthermore, it uses trend analysis to predict errors so that the network is always available. This can be established by monitoring different things for abnormal behavior.

Severities

CRITICAL: Critical production issue affecting all users, including system unavailability and data integrity issues with no workaround available.

- Service is down or unavailable.
- A critical part of the infrastructure is unavailable or inaccessible, resulting in total disruption of work or critical business impact.
- Service crashes or hangs indefinitely causing unacceptable or indefinite delays for resources or response.
- Data corrupted or lost and must restore from backup.
- A critical documented feature / function is not available.

MAJOR: Major functionality is impacted or significant performance degradation is experienced. Issue is persistent and affects many users and/or major functionality. No reasonable workaround available.


- Service is operational but highly degraded performance to the point of major impact on usage.
- Important features of the Software as a Service offering are unavailable with no acceptable workaround; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion.
- Access to a particular third-party application or service provider deemed noncritical is impacted

MINOR: Partial, non-critical loss of functionality of the software

System performance issue or bug affecting some but not all users. Short-term workaround is available, but not scalable.


- Service is operational but partially degraded for some or all customers, and an acceptable workaround or solution exists.
- Problem with non-critical feature or functionality
