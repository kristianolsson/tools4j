/**
 * Events are any occurence in the system that may information to be reported to somewhere
 * somehow. Events can be reported to multiple users and communication channels. 
 * 
 * Example of events are: successful execution/acceptance of a request or asynchronous job, 
 * encountering any kind of faults or failures (both abortable and recoverable), informative 
 * log statement of state changes, transaction-logs etc. 
 *  
 * Events can be reported to different communication channels and users: A log file for 
 * administrators/developers, inside exceptions thrown to end-users or different sub-systems,
 * as return value etc.
 * 
 * It should be possible to use module and code to uniquely correlate the event within 
 * the system.
 * 
 * Events are considered part of the public interface of a modulem, thus it is ruled by 
 * interface compatibility guidelines.

 * TODO: fix localization.
