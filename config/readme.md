# Tools4j Config: Configuration Management for the Enterprise

## Mission and purpose

The mission of the project is to minimize the complexity around being able to dynamically manage change of behaviour for highly-available and long running server-side applications in a reliable and predictable way. 

A key goal is to maximise developer and operator productivity by unifying the way configuration is used and managed for Java-based enterprise applications.

Applications are not required to run  Java SE, EE, OSGi, Spring, CDI or any other runtime environment, programming model or framework. The aim is to integrate seamlessly with all of those without affecting  application interfaces.

## Goals  
To fill a relevant need in the community and dynamically be able to manage configuration we believe that the following goals should be pursued. 

* Productivity and Simplicity  
Introducing and managing configuration must be non-intrusive and support developer productivity.

* Predictability and Clarity  
It is possible to declaratively express the intents and rules under which configuration is valid. Violations are handled in a consistent and predictable way that does not affect application behaviour. Changes are applied and exposed to applications reliably.

* Extendability and Portability  
A diversity of  applications  in different shapes and sizes  running different platforms and technologies are anticipated to be supported. Applications will have the freedom and flexibility to locally extend and customize a variety aspects and still be able to manage configuration in a central and unified way.

* Performance and Scalability  
Configuration must be quickly accessible to be able to meet service-level agreements in environments of scale.
