# Tools4j Config

## Configuration Management for the Enterprise

The mission of the project is to minimize the complexity around being able to dynamically manage change of behaviour for highly-available and long running server-side applications in a reliable and predictable way. 

A key goal is to maximise developer and operator productivity by   unifying the way configuration is used and managed for Java-based enterprise applications.

Applications are not required to run  Java SE, EE, OSGi, Spring, CDI or  any other runtime environment, programming model or framework. The aim is to integrate seamlessly with all of those without affecting  application interfaces.
